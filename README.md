# TwistedSemifields
Calculators for 27-Element Twisted Fields. This code was written in 2015 and was one of my first coding projects. It was conceived based on a need to find patterns in the multiplication tables of 27-element Twisted Fields, as constructed by A. A. Albert. 

This project led to a master's thesis which concluded that multiplication in these semifields could be reduced to a multiplication table with only 2 important entries. A vast improvement from the previous 9. This was accomplished by searching the data and finding 2-periodic bases for the semifields to use in computation.
